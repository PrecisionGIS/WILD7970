Assignment 1

ChatGPT: five priorities for research
Eva A. M. van Dis, Johan Bollen, Willem Zuidema, Robert van Rooij & Claudi L. Bockting*

This article discusses the impact of ChatGPT in the field of science and research. It is a Large Language Model (LLM), which after training on large datasets can generate sophisticated outputs like, talk summarization, literature draft, computer coding, and statistical analysis. Although it has the potential to revolutionize research practices and publication, it remains a matter of serious concern that needs to be considered. The first point of discussion is reducing the quality and transparency of research and fundamentally altering human autonomy.
According to the authors, the use of this technology is inevitable, so banning it will not work. It is imperative that the research community engages in debate about the implications of this potentially disruptive technology. To improve it, they have outlined the following five major issues:

(a)	Hold on to human verification: Emphasizing the importance of accountability in science, human verification is critical to maintaining the credibility of research for LLM use.
(b)	Develop rules for accountability: AI-generated content is difficult to detect, but integrity is key. Research articles/drafts should clearly state their use and publishers/funding authorities must lay down clear rules.
(c)	Invest in truly open LLMs: Ethical concerns arise from big companies’ secrets, which is a problem. To solve this, we need to create AI that's open for everyone. Non-profit groups, schools, and big tech companies should work together to make this happen. It will make AI better and transparent.
(d)	Embrace the benefits of AI: Incorporating AI into education and research can be a good thing. However, it can replace some of human skill and creativity in research. Still, there is potential to work together and achieve greater progress. It is important for policy makers to discuss the balance to accelerate research and sustain human inputs.
(e)	Widen the debate: It is important to foster practical engagement, create an international platform for responsible use, and examine impacts on research diversity and inequalities. Balancing these opportunities and challenges will help protect the fundamental principles of scientific inquiry.

### Assignment 2

Equitable hiring strategies towards a diversified faculty

The article explores equitable hiring strategies aimed at diversifying faculty in academia. A diverse faculty is critical to inclusive education, diverse perspectives, and combating academic inequity. This study examines the strategies, their implementation, and their impact on faculty diversity. To achieve this, the study combines quantitative analysis of hiring data, interviews with teachers’ administrators, and collecting data from multiple institutions and evaluating contracting practices over time.
In this context, I think it would be an ideal approach to conduct a comprehensive study on this topic to examine the strategies and their impacts on effective diversity. To accomplish this objective, mixed methods of quantitative analysis should be adopted. As faculty hiring practices shift to diversify the professoriate, the call is essential because it underscores the urgency of the issue, provides concrete leadership for needed changes, protects equity, and accountability, while ensuring that institutions take steps toward a diverse and inclusive faculty. 

### Assignment 3

How scientists fool themselves – and how they can stop

How scientists fool themselves – and how they can stop
The main keywords of this article are reproducibility crisis, scientific research, data analysis, cognitive bias. Reproducibility concerns arise primarily due to inconsistent replication of scientific findings. Discussion on this topic began in 2015 and is still a major topic of concern today, with a great need for all of us to be accountable for maintaining research integrity and transparency. 
Cognitive Biases and Research Pitfalls are the main contributors to this topic. Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, they significantly impact research practices and outcomes. This can be mainly understood in the following points:
Academic Competition: Intense competition in academia fuels the pursuit of statistically significant results (p < 0.05).
Complex Data: Challenges for statistical analysis. 
Research Integrity: Trying too hard to find stronger connections in data.
Research Pitfalls: 
Hypothesis Myopia: Focusing on one hypothesis, ignoring contrary evidence.
Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy: Choosing only the data that fits what you already think or believe.
Asymmetric Attention: Scrutinizing unexpected results more rigorously.
Just-So Storytelling: Crafting post-hoc explanations that may explain nothing.
JARKing (Justifying After Results are Known): Using creative language to make non-significant results seem significant.
To prevent reproducibility crisis in research and academia, we have to consider the following aspects; Promoting transparency, cognitive biases, robust inference, registered reporting, adversarial collaboration, and blind data analysis in science.


<mark> These are great summaries, Swati. Going forward, give us a bit more about what you specifically learned and or took away from the class discussion. Give us a bit of analysis, tell us your personal thoughts, and show us that you are critically thinking about these issues. How will you use AI going forward? Where do you draw the line? What are your thoughts on the value and role of the diversity statement in hiring? To be clear, I don't need you to go back and make any edits, I just want to give you some food for thought for future entries. - Jonathon

### Assignment 4

Title: Do Financial Conflicts of Interest Bias Research? An Inquiry into the “Funding Effect” Hypothesis
Sheldon Krimsky, Department of Urban & Environmental Policy & Planning, Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155, USA. Email: sheldon.krimsky@tufts.edu 

The article emphasizes the term "financial effect", which refers to the relationship between funding sources and study outcomes. There is sufficient evidence in drug efficacy and safety studies to conclude that the effects of research funding is real. Industry-sponsored trials are more likely to produce results consistent with the sponsor's commercial interests than trials sponsored by non-profit organizations, including government agencies. The circumstances points to two possible reasons: first, extensive internal testing with industry-sponsored drugs or biased testing methods to produce positive results, and second, the limited number of pharmacoeconomic studies showing the impact of funding. Without standardization of financial research or the use of external "auditors" who have no financial ties to the company, it is difficult to explain the factors that cause this effect. To address this problem, it is necessary to place significant emphasis on transparency, and prioritization of diverse funding sources to address the issue of financial impact on research outcomes. 
Pharmaceutical research directly impacts human health and well-being by discovering and developing new drugs (qualitative/quantitative), which are essential for improving the overall quality of life. We can take the example of COVID-19; Ongoing global concerns over health effects highlighted the importance of ensuring that research on such serious matters remains unbiased and free from funding influences or short-term motives to avoid compromising public health and safety. I believe that a multidimensional approach is necessary in the research field, where the credibility of the results must be ensured so that integrity can be maintained. Some more strict rules, research integrity training, and full incentives to publish negative results could further reduce the bias.

<mark> Easier said than done, unfortunately, but I totally agree. - Jonathon

### Assignment 5
Title: Citizen science in environmental and ecological sciences
Dilek Fraisl, Gerid Hager, Baptiste Bedessem, Margaret Gold, Pen-Yuan Hsing, Finn Danielsen, Colleen B. Hitchcock, Joseph M. Hulbert, Jaume Piera, Helen Spiers, Martin Thiel & Mordechai 

Citizen science is when ordinary people, not just scientists, help do research by collecting data. This approach makes science more accessible and involves more people in understanding the environment. However, we must ensure that the data collected is accurate and consider ethical issues for citizen science to work effectively. With the right support and collaboration, citizen science can be a powerful tool for learning and protecting our world.
Let's take an example of precision farming, farmers become citizen scientists, actively contributing to agricultural practices and environmental protection. They receive training and tools from local organizations and universities to collect precise data on soil, weather, crops, and resource usage. This collaborative effort not only redefines farming but also exemplifies how citizen science empowers communities while ensuring sustainable agricultural practices. 

<mark> Certainly a useful tool, but dangerous as well when the limitations are not fully appreciated. - Jonathon


### Assignment: R Shiny app

In the last class, we learned about R Shiny apps, which are great for making interactive web apps to share information easily.

### Assignment 6
When are hypotheses useful in ecology and evolution?

The article discusses the role of research hypotheses in the field of ecology and evolution. The prevalence and use of hypotheses in scientific studies, as well as their effects on the reproducibility and understanding of natural patterns, are examined by the authors. They discuss that hypotheses serve as an important tool to reduce bias and promote reproducibility. However, the authors note that despite the potential benefits, the prevalence of hypotheses in eco-evolutionary research is relatively low (ranging from 6.7% to 26%). The article is interesting because it challenges common reasons for not using hypotheses in ecological and evolutionary research. It argues that despite limited knowledge or complexity of ecology, hypotheses are important for understanding complex ecological problems. The article also emphasizes that important discoveries are not possible without hypotheses and encourages their use at various levels of research. It cautions against relying too heavily on predictive models, emphasizing the need to understand how things work in ecological and evolutionary studies. 
In science, hypotheses are considered crucial for guiding research and ensuring it's based on evidence. However, they can sometimes limit exploration, potentially causing researchers to miss unexpected discoveries.

<mark> I'd still like to see more of your opinions in your entries, Swati. What is your perspective of the role of the hypothesis in your work and/or modern science? - Jonathon
# I think research hypotheses play a significant role in modern science/research. The research hypothesis guides the research process and helps researchers identify the goals of their study, ultimately leading to the expansion of understanding.

### Assignment 7
Predatory journals: no definition, no defence

Grudniewicz et al. (2019) shed light on the topic of Predatory Journals in this article. The definition of predatory publishing has been agreed upon by leading scholars and publishers from 10 countries, which is “Predatory journals and publishers are entities that prioritize self-interest at the expense of scholarship and are characterized by false or misleading information, deviation from best editorial and publication practices, a lack of transparency, and/or the use of aggressive and indiscriminate solicitation practices”. At the beginning of the article, the author explains that Jane's hope for alternative cancer treatments was based on an article in a predatory magazine, which lacked credibility and rigorous review. This highlights the risks associated with relying on questionable sources for medical decisions.
Predatory publishing is a big problem in the world of research. These deceptive journals keep growing, tricking researchers and damaging the trust in scholarly work. The way they do this is by pretending to be real, respectable journals, even as the world of publishing is changing online. To fight this, there are some important things to do. First, researchers and institutions from different countries need to work together. This problem is worldwide, so cooperation is crucial. Next, we should have clear rules and explanations about what makes a journal good or bad. Educating researchers and universities about the dangers of predatory publishing is also important. Journals must promise to follow the best practices and show what they're doing, especially when it comes to reviewing articles and money. Universities and funders should focus more on quality and less on quantity when evaluating research. Having trustworthy lists of good and bad journals can help, and we must always keep an eye on predatory publishers who find new tricks. Transparency, where everything is clear and open, is key. Researchers should say where their money comes from, and journals should show how they review articles. By working together and being transparent, we can beat predatory publishing and make sure research stays trustworthy. 

<mark>Do you truly think we can "beat predatory publishing"? How will you integrate what you've learned into your own publishing practices going forward? - Jonathon
# I believe it is challenging to eliminate the influence of political networks on publications/ predatory publishing. I've learned the importance of transparency in my work and the need to avoid questionable journals. In the future, I'll focus on making sure each article I publish is excellent and suited for reputable journals.


### Assignment 8
A survey on how preregistration affects the research workflow: better science but more work

In this article, the authors surveyed 355 researchers, 299 of whom used pre-registration in their work. The study sample consisted exclusively of researchers in the field of psychology, presumably from differing career stages. This finding indicates positive experiences and expectations regarding the impact of pre-registration on research quality. Experienced pre-registration users found that the benefits outweighed the challenges, unlike those who were new to the practice. The findings of this article highlight the potential to improve and promote pre-registration within the scientific community.
In scientific research, preregistration is the process by which researchers formally record their research plans, including hypotheses, experimental designs, data collecting techniques, and statistical analysis protocols, before conducting their research. The study proposal is timestamped and made official by submitting this paperwork to a database or registry. An increased number of efforts to publish a preregistered study have been acknowledged in the literature. However, some statements made previously on the influence of preregistration on work-related stress contradict our findings. The concept of pre-registration is not new; it started at the beginning of the year 1878. It established three rules to guarantee that a hypothesis leads to a probable outcome, the first being that a hypothesis must be clearly stated before data can be collected to test its truth. In some research fields, such as medical clinical trials, pre-registration has long become a scientific routine.
In my opinion, preregistration can benefit research in numerous ways. Its main benefits include increasing methodological transparency, decreasing bias, improving repeatability, and eventually building confidence in the scientific community. While the path may not be easy and can present challenges, it is a better alternative to drawing false conclusions and promoting unsubstantiated hypotheses.

<mark>Ah ha!  We have a pre-registration believer in our midst!  Or has your mind changed after discussion today? If you end up trying this out, I'd love to hear about your experiences. - Jonathon
# Yesterday's class had an important discussion. I learned about 'pre-registration,' which seems like a great solution to many research problems. But hearing some personal experience and challenges with it made me a bit nervous. Still, I'm interested in trying it out in the future (Not Now).

### Assignment 9
Nobel and novice: Author prominence affects peer review

This study was pre-registered (Open Science Framework (OSF)), and approved by Elsevier (ref. IJsbrand Jan Aalbersberg, Senior Vice President of Research Integrity), the publisher of JBEF, and by the institutional review boards of the University of Graz (39/126/63 ex 2020/21) and the University of Innsbruck (13/2021).
Huber et al. conducted a comprehensive review involving 534 evaluation reports of the same manuscript, aimed at investigating potential biases in the peer review process. They wanted to see if there was any bias in how reviewers treated the paper based on the author's reputation. The authors used different scenarios, like having a well-known author, a not-so-famous author, or no author's name mentioned. What they found was that when the paper had a famous author, more reviewers agreed to review it, and they were more likely to give it a positive response/review. This suggests that reviewers tend to favor papers from famous authors, which is like the “halo effect.” The study supports the idea of keeping author identities hidden during peer review to reduce this bias and encourage diversity in academic publishing.
In my opinion, the research and publication landscape can be quite challenging, especially for students and scholars from various backgrounds, like me. One of the most significant hurdles is the publication process, which often feels like a complex and biased system. I believe that blind review, where the author's identity is hidden, is a crucial solution. It ensures that everyone has an equal chance to be heard and that their work is evaluated solely based on its quality, rather than their name or reputation. This approach is essential in providing a fair platform for all researchers, particularly those who may face biases based on their background or affiliation.

<mark>I couldn't agree more. I have a hard time understanding why everyone isn't doing double-blind peer review. - Jonathon

### Assignment 10
Science communication in experimental biology: experiences and recommendations

The purpose of this article is to inspire scientists, especially those in their early careers, to view scientific communication as a distinct and important ability. The author examines how science communication is changing during the Journal of Experimental Biology's century-long existence. It highlights how important scientific communication is becoming as an interdisciplinary field that covers both theory and real-world applications.
The article offers guidance for scientists looking to communicate with a general audience. It highlights the importance of understanding one's audience, effective storytelling, and avoiding technical jargon. Additionally, specific recommendations for engaging on social media are provided. The main objective is to empower scientists to enhance the impact of their work by shaping public opinion on critical issues such as the climate crisis, effectively conveying the significance of their research to the public and promoting acceptance of fundamental research and experiments (on animals). This article serves as a call to action for scientists, urging them to embrace their roles as communicators and bridge the knowledge gap between complex research and the public. 
In my view, it's essential to know your audience. Science communicators should understand what interests and concerns their audience has. They can learn this by talking to them, reading the kind of media they like, or teaming up with organizations that work with them. 

<mark>Whether we excel at it or not, we're going to have to learn to communicate with the general public if we want to get the information out. - Jonathon

### Assignment 11
Evidence for a mental health crisis in graduate education

Mental health issues in graduate students can stem from factors like academic pressure, work–life imbalance, financial stress, and uncertain career prospects. Insufficient support systems and stigma around mental health in academia contribute to the challenges these students face.
This article highlights the deteriorating mental health crisis among graduate students globally. Based on a survey of over 2,000 students from 26 countries, it reveals that graduate students are six times more likely to experience anxiety and depression compared to the general population. The study emphasizes the need for a better understanding of these issues and effective interventions. Factors such as gender, mentorship, and work–life balance significantly contribute to mental health struggles. The authors encourage for a "train-the-trainers" approach to educate faculty, emphasize the importance of work–life balance, and call for a cultural shift in academia to address the stigma surrounding mental health. The study concludes with a plea for further research and the establishment of mental health resources for graduate students.

### Assignment 12
Research Culture: A survey-based analysis of the academic job market

In this comprehensive study on the academic job market, researchers conducted a survey spanning May 2018 to May 2019, collecting insights from 317 postdoctoral researchers applying for faculty positions. The study aimed to fill the knowledge gap among applicants regarding the hiring process and the factors influencing job offers. Unveiling the demographics, it highlighted a gender imbalance and the predominance of life sciences respondents, mainly in North America. The survey delved into metrics such as publications and funding, revealing gender disparities and the significant impact of metrics like career transition awards on job offer rates. The analysis explored the complex interplay between various criteria, showcasing the multifaceted nature of successful applications. Moreover, it sheds light on the challenges faced by applicants, emphasizing the stressful, time-consuming, and feedback-limited nature of the process, irrespective of outcomes. Overall, the study highlights the need for transparency and improved understanding of the faculty hiring landscape. The findings challenge conventional wisdom by demonstrating that, beyond certain thresholds, traditional metrics like publications and funding do not distinctly differentiate successful and unsuccessful applicants. Stressing the limitations of these benchmarks, the study calls for enhanced transparency in the hiring process. The survey's findings on applicant struggles and the divergence in expectations between candidates and hiring institutions underscore the compelling need for reform in the academic hiring process. By dissecting the academic job market intricacies and emphasizing the nuanced evaluation criteria, the research provides valuable insights for both aspiring faculty and search committees, ultimately advocating for a more transparent and streamlined hiring process in academia.
